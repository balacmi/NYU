	 * TODO LIST
	 * 
	 * - Scoring (for missed rentals, the rest is done by the mode scorings them themselves!)
	 * - EventHandlers so people can easily listen to the raised events
	 * - Writing out the service defintions at the end of the simulation
	 * - Some basic analysis output
	 * 
	 * - Integration with MATSim Vehicles (-> bicycle contrib and car as underlying mode, the vehicle id in the service file should then correspond to existing vehicles)
	 * - Integration with EVs (-> ev contrib, which will automatically track the energy consumption if the underlying mode is network-based)
	 * 
	 * - Create test scenario (network + population)
